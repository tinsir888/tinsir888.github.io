      <title>丹麦皇冠——学生工体验</title>
      <link href="/posts/d81e7e66.html"/>
      <url>/posts/d81e7e66.html</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>从 2024 年 5 月到 2025 年 5 月，我在丹麦皇冠 (<a href="https://www.danishcrown.com/global/">Danish Crown</a>) 兰讷斯 (Randers) 总部的 Global IT 数据科学小组度过了一段充满成长与趣味的学生工时光。这份工作是如何得来的？详情可见 <a href="https://tinsir888.github.io/posts/ecaaaba7.html">这篇博文</a>。而本文，我想聊聊那些琐碎却生动的片段，它们拼凑出属于这一年的独特记忆。</p><h1 id="初入丹麦皇冠"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#初入丹麦皇冠"></a> 初入丹麦皇冠</h1><p>从奥胡斯搭乘 118 路公交车，一个小时的旅程就将我带到丹麦皇冠位于兰讷斯郊区的总部。这里没有城市的喧嚣，只有大片草坪与蓝天交织成画。远远望去，三栋建筑安静地伫立在广阔的绿野中，仿佛与自然融为一体。初夏的阳光透过窗子洒进办公室，办公桌上的笔记本与屏幕在光影间相映成趣，而窗外，树影婆娑，像是一幅宁静的风景画。</p><p><img src="/pic/arbeit/DCWorkExppic/1headquarter.jpg" alt="丹麦皇冠总部正面" /></p><p>初到公司的那一天，我在前台完成了拍照与入职手续。小组领导弗朗西斯亲自迎接我。他是个来自西班牙的小个子壮汉，阳光而热情，据我推测，或许是加泰罗尼亚人。接下来的安排显得体贴又随意：他带我去了早餐室，边享用美食边与团队其他成员熟络起来。</p><p><img src="/pic/arbeit/DCWorkExppic/2office.jpg" alt="办公室一隅" /></p><p>早餐室里，敏捷开发的第一次站会随即展开。我所在的小组堪称国际化：有波兰的菲利普，乌克兰的伊戈尔，还有丹麦的克里斯蒂安。他们个性各异，却都温和友善。初见时的紧张被这些轻松的互动渐渐化解，整个五月我都在适应和学习：了解公司的内部运作，熟悉 Azure 平台，以及试着把自己融入这支多元的团队。</p><p><img src="/pic/arbeit/DCWorkExppic/4office.jpg" alt="办公室另一边" /></p><h1 id="工作与生活的诗意平衡"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#工作与生活的诗意平衡"></a> 工作与生活的诗意平衡</h1><p>在这里，“工作与生活平衡”不仅是一句口号，更是一种深入骨髓的文化。</p><p>清晨八点到九点之间，员工陆续上班；下午四点之前，几乎所有人都准时下班。非工作时间无人会以公事打扰，就连“加班”这个词，似乎也是陌生的存在。但这并不意味着松散——在办公时间内，每个人都专注于自己的任务，效率高且富有责任感。</p><p>而这种自由也体现在办公形式上：混合办公制度让员工可以自由选择居家或现场工作，完全由个人安排。从未有人过问，也无人干涉。</p><p>下班后，站在公交车站等车，看天边晚霞渐渐褪去。那一刻，忙碌的白昼被温柔的黄昏取代，连空气也仿佛变得温润。</p><p><img src="/pic/arbeit/DCWorkExppic/3harfri.jpg" alt="下班后在公交车站等车回家" /></p><h1 id="工作中的小插曲"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#工作中的小插曲"></a> 工作中的小插曲</h1><p>七月因期末考试与暑假，工作暂时搁置；八月重新回归后，我的任务变得更明确。记得有一次，领导弗朗西斯刚布置完新任务，便去休产假了，留下我独立完成。过程虽有些挑战，但完成时的成就感也让我更有信心。</p><h1 id="公司食堂的味觉冒险"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#公司食堂的味觉冒险"></a> 公司食堂的味觉冒险</h1><p>公司的午餐是自助形式，28 克朗一顿的价格亲民得让人心动。然而，初尝丹麦传统菜式的我，却不得不在心里与“中国胃”妥协。</p><p>菜品丰富，主菜常常是热腾腾的肉类，配上些许酱汁。冷盘与沙拉搭配多样，但口味颇有“北欧特色”：比如黑麦面包的粗糙口感让我每次都望而却步，却见同事们抹着黄油吃得津津有味。</p><p>而地下冷库则是隐藏的福利宝库：员工可以半价购买冷冻的预制菜，其中的猪肋排成为我的最爱。带回家后抹上糖醋酱，烤上 30 分钟，便是美味的晚餐。</p><h1 id="变革的季节"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#变革的季节"></a> 变革的季节</h1><p>十月，公司迎来了新的 CEO。财务状况的调整伴随着裁员风暴席卷各部门。我们数据科学小组有幸未被波及，但隔壁的 PowerBI 团队就没这么幸运了。</p><p>我发现，同事们面对裁员的态度出奇地平静。这种从容源于丹麦社会的高福利制度：失业后只要积极找工作，便能获得足够生活的失业金。这一切，让我重新思考工作的意义与生活的保障。</p><h1 id="冬日的温柔时光"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#冬日的温柔时光"></a> 冬日的温柔时光</h1><p>冬令时的到来让早晨的阳光来得晚，黄昏的日暮退得早。上班时，踩着湿润的草坪，鼻尖满是泥土的芳香；下班时，落日的余晖染红天际，与归途的车辆交织成冬日的诗篇。这样的生活，简单却丰盈。</p><p><img src="/pic/arbeit/DCWorkExppic/6startwork.jpg" alt="上班" /></p><p><img src="/pic/arbeit/DCWorkExppic/5mywayhome.jpg" alt="下班转车途中" /></p><h1 id="vi-ses-danish-crown"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#vi-ses-danish-crown"></a> Vi ses, Danish Crown!</h1><p>一年时光，在清晨 118 路公交车的摇晃中，在键盘敲击与团队讨论的节奏里，在食堂偶尔的味觉挑战和冷库猪排的惊喜中，在夏日草坪的绿意与冬日归途的瑰丽晚霞里，悄然滑过。</p><p>站在终点回望，这段在Danish Crown的学生工旅程，早已超越了最初的技术学习与实践。它是一堂关于生活本身的生动课程：</p><ul><li>它教会我高效与松弛可以并存。 那些三四点下班的时刻，那些无人打扰的夜晚与周末，并非懈怠，而是对专注工作的信任与对个人生活的尊重。这份根植于丹麦文化中的平衡感，让我重新定义了“努力”与“休息”的边界。</li><li>它让我在多元的土壤中成长。 与来自西班牙、波兰、乌克兰、丹麦的同事们共事，不同的视角、工作方式乃至幽默感，不断拓宽着我的认知边界。在解决技术难题之外，理解与协作本身就成了宝贵的收获。</li><li>它让我体会平凡日常的诗意。 通勤路上的光影流转，午餐时间对“中国胃”的妥协与偶尔的味蕾发现，甚至裁员风波下同事们那份源自社会安全网的淡定。这些看似琐碎的片段，共同编织出这段经历独特而真实的纹理，远比任何宏大叙事更触动人心。</li><li>它赋予我前行的信心。 从初入职场的忐忑，到独立完成领导留下的任务，再到理解企业运作的复杂脉络。每一次小小的挑战与克服，都在默默夯实我的专业根基与处事能力。</li></ul><p><img src="/pic/arbeit/DCWorkExppic/6farwell.jpg" alt="再来一张总部正面的特写" /></p><p>“Vi ses”——丹麦语中的“再见”，带着“后会有期”的期许。告别 Randers 郊外那片宁静的绿野，告别 Global IT 数据科学小组熟悉的面孔，告别那扇旋转门后一年间的光与影。Danish Crown 给予我的，不仅是简历上的一行经历，更是一份关于如何工作、如何生活、如何在异国他乡找到自己节奏的珍贵体验。这份体验，如同兰讷斯冬日清晨草叶上的露珠，清新、短暂，却足以滋养下一段旅程。</p><p>Tak for alt, Danish Crown! 前方的路还长，但这段时光的光亮，将长久地映照脚下。</p>]]></content>

      <title>書之溯源 SourceBook —— 使用超分辨率技术修复低清扫描书的一款工具</title>
      <link href="/posts/27a2575b.html"/>
      <url>/posts/27a2575b.html</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="缘起"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#缘起"></a> 缘起</h1><p>最近手上拿到了几本书的 PDF 扫描版本，可惜分辨率过低，看着辣眼睛。急切需要将这几份 PDF 文件恢复到较高的分辨率。</p><p>Adobe Acrobat 这款商用软件应该提供了这个功能。但是，一是之前 NKU 给的教育账号早已失效，二是我既不想用盗版软件也不想使用付费的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">专有软件</a>，因此我希望找到 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a> 的替代方案。</p><h1 id="工具简介"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#工具简介"></a> 工具简介</h1><p>这两天在 GitHub 上偶然搜到了一个名为“书之溯源 SourceBook”的仓库。该仓库实现了使用超分辨率技术将低分辨率的扫描书恢复为高分辨率的功能。</p><h2 id="模型"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#模型"></a> 模型</h2><p>作者在 Readme 中介绍，本软件使用的模型是 <a href="https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/">Real-ESRGAN</a>。想深究具体原理的朋友可以读读 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219">ESRGAN</a> 和 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10833">Real-ESRGAN</a> 等相关论文。</p><p><a href="https://github.com/tumuyan/SourceBook-Dataset">模型训练使用的数据集</a> 是由作者自行搜集的。</p><h2 id="使用工具"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#使用工具"></a> 使用工具</h2><p>作者提供了两种方式：</p><p>一种是在<a href="https://github.com/tumuyan/SourceBook-Dataset/releases/tag/1.0.1">本地 Windows/Linux 系统上运行的软件包（需要安装 Java 依赖）</a>。由于我特别不希望在本地安装这些乱七八糟的依赖工具来“污染”我的硬盘，遂弃之。本文也不涉及此种方式的使用。</p><p>另一种是在谷歌 Colab 平台上白嫖算力，作者也贴心地把 <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E2IEo1zUapxMuOb2Px3VYy_zhDsu9OTR?usp=sharing">链接</a> 放出来了。本文大概描述一下使用这种方式的流程：</p><ol><li><p>首先运行初始化的代码，下载相应的包。</p></li><li><p>上传 PDF 文件到 Colab 平台上。⚠️这里建议先把 PDF 文件上传到谷歌网盘中，再装载谷歌云盘到 Colab。这样比直接上传到 Colab 平台上稳妥一些。</p><p>确认目标文件位于 <code>Real-ESRGAN/upload</code> 位置。</p></li><li><p>根据代码提示，输入文件名，设置导出图片，操作的相关参数。运行对应的代码片段。</p><p>代码的逻辑大概是：先把 PDF 拆分成一张一张的图片，暂存到 <code>Real-ESRGAN/upload/(文件名)_pdfimg/</code> 文件夹中；然后使用训练好的模型对这些图片一张一张的提升分辨率，结果暂存到 <code>Real-ESRGAN/upload/(文件名)_pdfimg_2x/</code> 文件夹中。</p></li><li><p>运行”把图片打包回 pdf 文件“的代码片段。</p><p>这一步就是用 <code>Real-ESRGAN/upload/(文件名)_pdfimg_2x/</code> 的图片去替换掉原来 pdf 文件中对应的页面，执行完的结果另存为 <code>Real-ESRGAN/upload/(文件名)[source-book].pdf</code>。</p><p>得到的这个结果就是最终想要的，可以直接下载，也可以扔硬盘里再下载。</p><p>之后的代码片段我就没管了。朋友们使用的时候按需运行即可。</p></li></ol><h2 id="待改进的地方"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#待改进的地方"></a> 待改进的地方</h2><p>首先感谢作者提供了一个不错的工具🌹</p><p>但此处也提出一些值得改进的地方：</p><ul><li><p>有的 PDF 文件中的页面虽然很糊，但是分辨率很高。在这种情况下根据代码设置会直接跳过。因此需要手动的去将这种页面的分辨率调低，不方便。</p></li><li><p>待处理的文件不能太糊，否则重建出来太奇怪了。一个特别糊的拉丁字母文档经过分辨率增强后亲测可能会变成”希伯来语字母“文档😓</p></li></ul>]]></content>

subgroup of that coalition has an incentive to break away and form a new coalition to achieve a more favorable outcome for themselves.</p><p>A globally trained model is core stable if there are no blocking coalitions.</p></blockquote><p>2 commonly used fairness notions</p><ol><li><p>Egalitarian fairness</p><p>Aims to maximize the utility of the least happy agent</p></li><li><p>Proportional

值压入数据栈中</li><li>针对寄存器：遍历所有寄存器名称，比对寄存器名和当前 token 对应字符串，如果成功匹配，将该寄存器对应的值压入数据栈中</li></ul><p>如果扫描到的是运算符。首先针对所有的运算符设计了一个优先级表格。查找该表格，可以得到符号栈顶的符号和当前 token 符号的优先级大小。</p><ul><li><p>在判断优先级之前，由于实现了解引用和符号的功能，需要先处理这几种特殊情况</p><p>判断如果前一个 token（<code>token[i-1]</code>）也是符号：</p><ul><li>如果识别出符号为 ‘-’，则当前符号会被认为是负号</li><li>如果识别出符号为 ‘*’，则当前符号会被认为是解引用</li></ul></li><li><p>如果栈顶符号优先级<strong>小于</strong>当前符号，直接将当前符号压入栈中</p></li><li><p>如果栈顶符号优先级<strong>大于</strong>当前符号，将栈顶符号弹出，连续从数据栈中弹出运算符需要个数的数据值，进行运算后，将结果压入数据栈中</p></li><li><p>如果栈顶符号优先级<strong>等于</strong>当前符号（对应到的是左右括号的匹配），直接将符号栈顶的符号弹出即可。</p></li><li><p>如果栈顶符号优先级无法与当前符号比较，只能说明输入的表达式有误。</p></li></ul></li></ol><h4

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>大三下的后半学期，华为 HR 突然找到我问我要不要去华为实习（后来发现应该是华为 HR 拿到了学校 ACM-ICPC 获奖名单来一个一个找的）。我当时就想，暑假反正没啥事干，闲着也是闲着，不如去工业界体验一下，顺便刷个实习经历以后好在简历上多写一行。于是乎就投简历了。简历交上去后，按照 HR 的指示，投了华为 ICT 计算产品线的通用软件开发工程师的实习岗位。</p><h1 id="个人情况"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#个人情况"></a> 个人情况</h1><h2 id="实习经历"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#实习经历"></a> 实习经历</h2><p>无</p><h2 id="项目经历"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#项目经历"></a> 项目经历</h2><p>无，只有把某些课程的大作业勉强写上凑数。</p><h2 id="竞赛经历"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#竞赛经历"></a> 竞赛经历</h2><p>只有两块 ACM-ICPC 的铜牌（太菜了）</p><h1 id="简历制作"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#简历制作"></a> 简历制作</h1><ul><li>个人信息+联系方式</li><li>教育背景（什么学分绩、四六级、雅思啥的都写上去）</li><li>项目经历、竞赛经历、实习经历</li></ul><p>用 markdown 写的，特别简陋，特别“敷衍”，交上去的时候还是感觉挺尴尬的。</p><p>PS：在此之前投过 GitLab 远程实习。估计是简历的原因，直接就被刷了。</p><h1 id="面试过程"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#面试过程"></a> 面试过程</h1><h2 id="职业风格测评"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#职业风格测评"></a> 职业风格测评</h2><p>HR 让做的职业风格测评，我挂了两次，第三次才过。就是一个测试网站，做题的时候要清醒，别前后有关联的题目选择时出现矛盾的情况。做的时候不要管那么多，尽量让自己看起来“正能量”一些（</p><h2 id="上机考试"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#上机考试"></a> 上机考试</h2><p>华为规定，ACM-ICPC 拿过奖的，免机考，所以我就免了。但是听其它有的人说机考编程题的难度不大。</p><h2 id="技术面试"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#技术面试"></a> 技术面试</h2><p>首先自我介绍，然后问了一些专业上的情况。这个面试官有点秃顶，一看就很强。他说他们搞存储、纠错啥的。我啥都不知道，听得我一脸懵😭。</p><p>他又问我有没有什么项目经历（没有）。</p><p>之后又问我在竞赛中用过什么算法/数据结构。我当时脑抽随口就说了一个 LCT（Link-cut Tree，给自己挖坑嘛这是😰）,然后他要我讲这玩意的具体思路。我当时结结巴巴说了一堆，讲的很不好。</p><p>之后面试官又让我现场做一道力扣上的弱智题。可能是因为太紧张？做了好一会才做出来。</p><p>结束技术面试之后感觉自己可能会被挂吧，总之不太好。</p><h2 id="主管面试"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#主管面试"></a> 主管面试</h2><p>没想到技术面试过了。接下来就是主管面试。就比较随意地跟部门主管聊嘛，聊的还行，比较放松。</p><h1 id="薪资待遇"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#薪资待遇"></a> 薪资待遇</h1><p>华为的实习生统一 6000 元/月，如果家和学校都不在当地，外加 1000 元/月的房补。另外去的路费可以报销。</p><p>我是在杭州研究所实习，食堂饭菜一般，偏贵。</p><p>有免费健身房（懒，没去过）。</p><p>活动挺多。</p><p>杭州夏天真的是太热了，哪都去不成👿。</p><p>周一到周五保证核心工作时间在岗（9:00 - 17:30）并且每天 8 小时（8:00 - 17:30 或 9:00 - 20:00）的工时就行。原则上实习生不加班，加班也没有加班费，但是想拿晚上的免费夜宵需要待到 20:35（为了让你多加会班，算是比较鸡贼）。</p><p>待遇看起来一般吧。</p><h1 id="工作内容"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#工作内容"></a> 工作内容</h1><p>我到了之后就被分配到 AI 的小组，具体是搞计算机视觉的。我有点纳闷，这和技术面试的时候面试官讲的内容可以说毫无关联。后面听 PL（Project Leader）说，他看了我的简历觉得还行，就捞过来搞计算机视觉了。</p><p>所有的实习生被安排一个导师 mentor 和一个主管（一般是 PL）。导师人很 nice，监督指导我的工作并在空闲时解答我的疑惑。整个小组氛围挺好的，看起来压力好像也没想象中那么大。</p><p>我导师没让我参与组内的工程项目，而是进行预研：CV 领域里面自监督学习算法的广泛调研和某一自监督学习算法论文的复现（虽然最终都没有达到理想的效果）。调研的论文都是最新最前沿的（有的论文还是前几天刚出的，甚至还调研到了我们学院老师头上😂）。事后自觉收获颇丰。</p><p>平时也有摸鱼。</p><h1 id="总结"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#总结"></a> 总结</h1><p>总体来说，感觉在挺不错的（会不会因为是实习生，并且没有后续正式入职的需求），算是一段满意的实习经历。看作为正式员工的同事们加班也没想象当中那么严重（一般就每周周一、二、四加班到晚上九点、月末周六全天加班）。压力还是有的，杭研所为例，年轻人特别多，像个学校（35 岁退休应该是真的？）后续也投了华为的秋招，弄着玩的，就算 pass 了也不一定去。</p>]]></content>

表示继续执行到程序结束，输入该命令可以看到 <code>hit good trap</code> 的提示，说明程序正常执行结束；命令 <code>q</code> 表示退出 NEMU。</p><p><img src="/pic/ysyx-prelearning-pic/12.PNG" alt="" /></p><h3 id="基础设施简易调试器"><a

实验还是有些区别的。</p></blockquote><h4 id="实现单步执行"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#实现单步执行"></a> 实现单步执行</h4><p>在 sdb.c 代码文件，先在 cmd_table 中加入该指令的描述。</p><p>然后在外部实现 <code>cmd_si</code> 指令。</p><p>具体思路是，利用 <code>strtok</code> 函数对输入按空格进行分词，将判断是否有参数传入。如果没有参数，就只执行一次 <code>cpu_exec(1)</code>，如果有参数，将参数转化成十进制表示，并传入 <code>cpu_exec</code> 中，执行对应的次数。</p><p>实现结果如下：</p><p><img

<code>cmd_info</code> 指令。</p><p>参数有 r 和 w，此处暂时实现 r 参数对应的操作，不管 w 参数。直接调用 <code>isa_reg_display()</code> 函数。~~果然，“升级版本”的 PA 实验函数封装得更完善。~~该函数需要自己实现，在 reg.c 中。此时和之前我完成的 x86 版本就不一样了。RISC-V 体系结构的寄存器完全不一样。通过 RTFSC 查看可调用的 api 接口 <code>gpr()</code>，该接口为 reg.h 中的宏定义，根据索引取出对应编号寄存器的值。为了方便展示，同时打印出了寄存器值的十六进制和十进制。</p><p><code>info r</code> 指令的实现结果如下：</p><p><img src="/pic/ysyx-prelearning-pic/14.PNG" alt=""

指令。</p><p>首先需要通过分词检查参数个数是否合法。</p><p>然后得到第二个值。第二个值表示扫描的长度。</p><p>第三个值本来应该是一个表达式，此处为了简化，暂时处理为一个十六进制的数字。</p><p>调用 <code>vaddr_read</code> 函数对内存进行读取，再输出即可。</p><p>该指令的实现结果如下：<s>经查阅相关文档发现，RISC-V 和 x86 一样，也是小端模式编址。</s></p><p><img src="/pic/ysyx-prelearning-pic/15.PNG" alt="" /></p><p><em>预学习阶段到此结束</em>🎆🎆🎆</p>]]></content>
